      question: "Are all classes really free?",

    },
    {
      question: "How big are the classes?",
      answer: "Classes typically have 2–4 students. This keeps groups small enough for personal attention, while still allowing kids to learn and practice with their peers."
    },
    {
      question: "What level of players can join?",
      answer: "We welcome students from complete beginners to around 1400 USCF. If your child is above that level, please reach out to discuss advanced coaching opportunities."
    },
    {
      question: "Where do classes take place?",
      answer: "Classes are held online through Google Meet and Lichess."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my child misses a class?",
      answer: "No problem! Since our program is flexible, students can miss a class occasionally. We encourage regular attendance for best results, but we post lesson reviews weekly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do students get homework?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide optional practice exercises and puzzles each week. While not required, completing homework helps reinforce what's learned in class."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my child get a chance to play in tournaments?",
      answer: "Yes! At the end of each summer session, we host a tournament where students can compete against others at their level. We also encourage participation in USCF-rated events."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know what class to sign up for?",
      answer: "Beginner: Students who casually play against family or friends (No USCF Rating). Intermediate: Students who are in a school club or play online regularly (USCF Rating under 800). Advanced: Players who compete in OTB tournaments or are on a school team (USCF Rating over 800). If you are unsure, feel free to contact Vedh.bagare@gmail.com."

            In 2025, we launched Pawn to Queen Chess Coaching with a simple idea: free, structured chess coaching for everyone. Since then, we’ve grown to a community of over 80 families across Wisconsin and even had some success internationally in Canada. In 2026, we plan to expand by offering in-person coaching and opening chapters in other states. With every new student, we show that all pawns have the potential to become a queen.

                <p>
                  My name is Vedh Bagare, and I am a rising Sophomore at Brookfield East High School. 
                  I have been playing chess for most of my life and got into competitive chess a few years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got into chess coaching through teaching my sister and friends. I founded this academy 
                  because when I began my competitive journey, I couldn't find any free coaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have many friends who love chess, but don't know how to improve, and through this academy, 
                  I hope to support them and give back to the chess community as a whole.
